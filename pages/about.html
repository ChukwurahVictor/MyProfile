         <h1 style="text-align:left;">About me</h1>

         <!-- <p style="text-align:left;"> I'm a multi talented, ambitious and creative super woman with the ability to write amazing 
            computer programs. Write something cool about yourself here  
         </p> -->

         <p style="text-align:left;">
            I have always been passionate about computers since I was a child and after my secondary school, I enrolled in a computer
            training school where I learnt the basics of computer repairs. My passion for computers also pushed me to apply to study 
            Computer Engineering at the University of Benin where I am currently studying.
         </p>

         <p style="text-align:left;">
            I started web development a little over a year ago having been introduced to it by a friend and I have since been learning and 
            working hard to become a better developer. My goal is to one day become a world-class fullstack developer.
         </p>

         <p style="text-align:left;">
            I see myself as a creative and inventive person who is always eager to learn, pays attention to detail and is passionate about
            meeting deadlines.
         </p>
         
         <br/>
         
         <h1 style="text-align:left;">Qualifications & Skills</h1>

         <p style="text-align:left;"> I have vasertile skills. I can write code in HTML, CSS and Javascripts. 
            I also know how to manage both relational (Postgres) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases.
         </p>
         
         <!-- <p style="text-align:left;"> I graduated from University of Lagos. I studied Computer Science. Write something cool here. Sell yourself. 
            </p> -->

         <p style="text-align:left;"> I am a final year student at the University of Benin studying Computer Engineering. I had the 
            opportunity of doing my compulsory six months internship in a company where I learnt about the basics of networking and
            connecting live devices including routers and switches.
